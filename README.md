This is Mimecrafter.com, the minecraft website that represents the unity of all that the Minecraft company has created. The website attempts to display the varity that Minecraft and its community nutured, from the different games, to play styles and even the people the people that the game has connected with. With 11 years since the birth of this blocky world, i want to describe it with the various colours of assets of Minecraft and merging them into one fine website. The community has also impacted the game and the company greately too. 

Design process.
The initial idea was clear, one page would be a realm. There would be one piece of art as the back ground while text will somewhat cover it. The community came afterwards. I thought i could bring this concpt one stepm futher, with indicidual backgrounds. well, it did :).
